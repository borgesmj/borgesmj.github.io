## If you're reading this, it's because I did it ðŸŽ‰,
I managed to create a new version of my portfolio website and add a blog site where I can post my ideas, thoughts, projects, advice, and more.

## But first, let me introduce myself.
I'm Miguel Borges, a FrontEnd web developer (though I won't exclude the BackEnd; we'll learn it together). Where was I? Oh yeah, I'm Miguel. I'm from Venezuela. Years ago, back in 2015, I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer. I worked at PDVSA as a QA/QC inspector for two years until I traveled to Colombia with my family, and since then, I've been living here.

I decided to become a web developer seeking challenges, and I did find a couple of really challenging ones. But that's the best part of this world; we never get enough and always want to become better and better, learning from the best in the field and, someday, becoming one to teach new people.

Right now, I'm focused on FrontEnd and Reactjs, but I have dabbled a little in NodeJs, NextJs, even Python, and also Astro... THIS SITE IS MADE WITH [**ASTRO!!**](https://docs.astro.build/es/getting-started/) It's amazing, this framework, but we will talk about it later. For now, that's all I'm going to say about myself. I bid you farewell, but not without asking you to visit my  [**website**](https://borgesmj.github.io) or my  [**Github page**](https://github.com/borgesmj), and maybe we can work together.  [**contact me ðŸ“§**](https://borgesmj-portfolio.netlify.app/contact), and I'll contact you.
